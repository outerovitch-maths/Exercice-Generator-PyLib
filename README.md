# Math Exercise Generator

This Python project generates random mathematical exercises, including algebra, geometry, and calculus problems. It is designed to help users practice math problems at various difficulty levels.

## Features
- Generates random algebra, geometry, and calculus problems.
- Supports different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).
- Uses a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/math-exercise-generator.git
cd math-exercise-generator
```

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment
Create and activate a virtual environment to keep your dependencies isolated.

#### On Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the necessary Python libraries using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the program and generate a random math exercise, simply run the `main.py` file:
```bash
python main.py
```

The program will prompt you to choose a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard), and then it will display a randomly generated math problem.
